however, strong balance sheet (net cash ~$60B) mitigates.\n- Exit multiple rationale: EV/EBITDA chosen for high-growth tech firms like Microsoft, with 20x based on historical 18-25x range and forward expectations, reflecting profitability and growth profile over P/E or EV/FCF for mature software.\n","rawFinancialAnalysis":"","companyName":"Microsoft Corporation","method":"exit-multiple","fairValue":933,"currentSharePrice":476.3900146484375,"discountRate":null,"terminalGrowth":null,"exitMultipleType":"EV/EBITDA","exitMultipleValue":20,"upside":95.84793369116434,"cagr":14.388877630370555,"sections":{"forecastTable":"\nCompany Name: Microsoft Corporation\n\nFinancial Forecast 2024-2029:\n\nYear | Revenue ($M) | Revenue Growth (%) | Gross Margin (%) | EBITDA Margin (%) | FCF Margin (%) | Net Income ($M) | EPS\n---- | ------------ | ------------------ | ---------------- | ----------------- | -------------- | --------------- | ---\n2024 | 293812      | -                  | 68.8             | 57.8              | 35            | 104912         | 14.06\n2025 | 333000      | 13.3               | 68.8             | 58                | 35            | 120546         | 16.15\n2026 | 382000      | 14.7               | 68.8             | 58                | 35            | 142868         | 19.14\n2027 | 444000      | 16.2               | 68.8             | 58                | 35            | 168720         | 22.61\n2028 | 516000      | 16.2               | 68.8             | 58                | 35            | 201240         | 26.97\n2029 | 600000      | 16.2               | 68.8             | 58                | 35            | 240000         | 32.16\n\nExit Multiple Valuation:\nExit Multiple Type: EV/EBITDA\nExit Multiple Value: 20\n2029 Metric Value: 348000\nFair Value: $933 per share\n\nCurrent Share Price: $476.39\n\nAssumptions and Justifications:\n- Revenue projections are based on Wall Street consensus estimates for 2025-2028 revenues ($333B, $382B, $444B, $516B respectively), with 2029 extrapolated at 16.2% growth to $600B, aligning with 14-18% annual growth forecasts and Microsoft's historical 10-15% CAGR, driven by Azure and AI.\n- Gross margin held stable at 68.8% reflecting Microsoft's high-margin software business, with limited pressure from cloud scaling efficiencies offsetting potential commodity costs.\n- EBITDA margin increased slightly from 57.8% in 2024 to 58% in 2025-2029, assuming operational efficiencies in cloud and AI investments, consistent with historical trends and analyst expectations of stable/rising margins.\n- FCF margin projected at 35% across years, based on Microsoft's strong cash generation history (around 30-40%), assuming capex remains manageable despite AI infrastructure investments, with net margin rising to 40% by 2029 per consensus.\n- Net income and EPS calculated using projected revenues and margins, with shares outstanding at ~7.46B (derived from 2024 EPS and NI), assuming no significant dilution from buybacks or issuances.\n- Growth drivers include 40%+ Azure/cloud growth and AI adoption via Copilot, potentially reaching $500B+ revenue by 2030, supported by enterprise digital transformation trends.\n- Product/segment dynamics: Productivity and cloud segments (Office, Azure) expected to contribute ~60% of revenue, with AI integrations boosting adoption in gaming and devices.\n- Margin levers: Cost efficiencies in R&D and sales/marketing, offset by AI capex, leading to net margin expansion from 35.7% in 2024 to 40% in 2029.\n- Capital intensity: High capex on AI/data centers (up to $50B annually) may pressure FCF initially, but long-term efficiencies from cloud scale will support margins.\n- Competitive landscape: Intense rivalry in cloud/AI from AWS/Google, but Microsoft's ecosystem advantage (Windows, Teams) provides differentiation and pricing power.\n- Risks: Market volatility, AI bubble concerns, regulatory scrutiny on antitrust, and high P/E (~34) could impact growth;
